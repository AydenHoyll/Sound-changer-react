# React sound change app

The idea of this project was inspired by Mark Rosenfelder aka Zompist (https://www.zompist.com/sca2.html) and his 2012 app to implement sound changes. 

I made an updated version, adding react, re-design, and major refactoring to his original code. 
The original code underwent a whole refactoring process from updating code to ECMAScript 2015 to logic decomposition. 

Would love to collaborate on this more if anyone is interested.

To start this project on your machine:
