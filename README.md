# React sound change app

The idea of this project was inspired by Mark Rosenfelder aka Zompist (https://www.zompist.com/sca2.html) and his 2012 app to implement sound changes. 

I made an updated version, adding react, re-design, and major refactoring to his original code, like re-writing into modern JS standards and decomposing the logic of the app.

Would love to collaborate on this more if anyone is interested.
